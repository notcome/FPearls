Calculate the smallest natural number not in a given finite set X of natural numbers.

- `v0.hs`: the specification
- `v1.hs`: a linear time solution I thought by myself, using a [binary search algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm).
- `v2.hs`: an array based solution on _Pearls_
